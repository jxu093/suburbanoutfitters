# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## Environment variables (local)

This project reads configuration from environment variables so you can keep API keys out of source control.

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and add your real API keys (the `.env.local` file is already ignored):

```text
# .env.local
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweathermap_api_key_here
```

- `app.config.js` loads `.env.local` and injects `WEATHER_API_KEY` into `expo` config `extra` so it is available at runtime via:

```ts
import Constants from 'expo-constants';
const key = Constants.expoConfig?.extra?.WEATHER_API_KEY;
```

- Do NOT commit `.env.local`. Use `.env.example` for sharing env variable names in the repo.
